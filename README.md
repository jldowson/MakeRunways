# MakeRunways
A  simple utility which extracts selected airport data from active scenery, basing its scan on the active SCENERY.CFG file.

It produces data files for all versions of Radar Contact, for FStarRC, and for several other programs. The latest version is suitable for FS2002, FS2004, FSX, P3D and MSFS running on Windows 10.

To compile, please use VisualStudio 2022 or later - the project uses the v143 build tools together with the latest Windows SDK 10 (10.0.19041.0 at time of writing).

Please see the Documentation sub-folder for the user manual/readme together with some documentation on BGL file formats.
Note that the BGL File Format - FSDeveloper Wiki.pdf is taken from the followung wiki page which may contain more up-to-date information:
