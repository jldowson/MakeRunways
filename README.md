# MakeRunways
A  simple utility which extracts selected airport data from active scenery, basing its scan on the active SCENERY.CFG file.

It produces data files for all versions of Radar Contact, for FStarRC, and for several other programs. The latest version is suitable for FS2002, FS2004, FSX, P3D and MSFS running on Windows 10.

IMPORTANT: For FS2002, FS2004 and FSX running on earlier versions of Windows than Win10 you will need version 4.70 instead:  https://fsuipc.simflight.com/beta/MakeRunways_470.zip
